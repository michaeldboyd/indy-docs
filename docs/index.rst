This is currently just a prototype of our proposed Indy documentation library. Please give your feedback on whether this would be useful on the `Improvement Proposal <https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/63>`_ we've written.    

Hyperledger Indy provides tools, libraries, and reusable components for providing digital identities rooted on blockchains or other distributed ledgers so that they are interoperable across administrative domains, applications, and any other silo.

If you are a developer, begin your journey in our `getting-started guide <https://indy.readthedocs.io/projects/sdk/en/latest/getting-started/getting-started.html>`_.

Key Characteristics
-------------------
    - Distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity
    - Correlation-resistant by design
    - DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) that are globally unique and resolvable (via a ledger) without requiring any centralized resolution authority
    - Pairwise Identifiers create secure, 1:1 relationships between any two entities
    - Verifiable Claims are interoperable format for exchange of digital identity attributes and relationships currently in the standardization pipeline at the W3C
    - Zero Knowledge Proofs which prove that some or all of the data in a set of Claims is true without revealing any additional information, including the identity of the Prover
